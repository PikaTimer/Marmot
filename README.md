## There are two modes of operation:

### Manual:

### Automatic: 
* Use the Auto-Sync button to automatically  participant data from [PikaTimer](https://github.com/PikaTimer/) v1.6+ running on the local network.
* Marmot will then automatically load the participants information and keep any updates in sync.
